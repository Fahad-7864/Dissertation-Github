# MSc Dissertation - Creating a Unique Combat System
This repository contains the full version of my Master's dissertation, completed in 2023, which explores the design and development of a unique combat system within turn-based games. The project, developed in Unity, introduces an innovative combat mechanic aimed at enhancing player engagement and enjoyment.

Research Focus
The primary question addressed in this dissertation is:
"How does the introduction of a distinctive combat mechanic influence player engagement and enjoyment in turn-based games?"

To answer this, the project explores:

The history and characteristics of turn-based games.
Analysis of popular games like Baldur's Gate and Divinity: Original Sin.
Introduction of a new combat mechanic in the form of a minigame involving a rotating wheel and pointer, adding a skill-based layer to the traditional turn-based format.
Core Features
The project introduces a unique combat system with the following key features:

Rotating Wheel Minigame: A skill-based mechanic that allows players to influence combat outcomes.

Increased Player Skill Engagement: Compared to traditional systems, the mechanic emphasizes player input and mastery.
Customizable Turn Order Systems: Flexible and adaptable combat structure.
Isometric Movement: A strategic gameplay perspective, allowing a clearer view of the battlefield and tactical planning.
Methodology
The development process utilized:

The A Pathfinding Algorithm* for smooth and efficient NPC movement.
Isometric Movement Systems to enhance the tactical gameplay experience.
Unity's extensive tools for creating a well-rounded turn-based experience.
Additionally, the project incorporates:

Psychological Factors: Reward systems and player autonomy to boost satisfaction.
Age-Based Preferences: Considering the variation in gaming preferences across different age groups, the project tailors gameplay pace accordingly.
Turn Order System
The project also includes a detailed turn order system for managing combat flow.
